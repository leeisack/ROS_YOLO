# Robot-Operating-System
#### ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Basically, it works in the Ubunto environment.

#### As hardware, I use a zed2 camera and a jetson xavier. Therefore, if you are using different hardware, following these instructions may not produce the same results.
